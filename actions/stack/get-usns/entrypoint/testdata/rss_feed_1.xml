            <title>USN-7840-1: Ruby vulnerabilities</title>
            <link>https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7840-1</link>
            <description>It was discovered that the REXML module bunded into Ruby incorrectly
                handled parsing XML documents with repeated instances of certain
                characters. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause REXML to
                consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 18.04
                LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS were previously addressed in USN-7256-1 and
                USN-7734-1. This update addresses the issue in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
                (CVE-2024-35176)

                It was discovered that the REXML module bunded into Ruby incorrectly
                handled parsing XML documents with repeated instances of certain
                characters. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause REXML to
                consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 20.04
                LTS was previously addressed in USN-7256-1. This update addresses the issue
                in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-39908, CVE-2024-41123)

                It was discovered that the REXML module bunded into Ruby incorrectly
                handled parsing XML documents with many entity expansions. An attacker
                could possibly use this issue to cause REXML to consume excessive
                resources, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was previously
                addressed in USN-7091-2. This update addresses the issue in Ubuntu 16.04
                LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2024-41946)

                It was discovered that the WEBrick module bundled into Ruby incorrectly
                handled having both a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header.
                A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a HTTP request
                smuggling attack. (CVE-2024-47220)

                It was discovered that the WEBrick module bundled into Ruby incorrectly
                parsed HTTP headers. In configurations where the WEBrick module is placed
                behind an HTTP proxy, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to
                perform an HTTP Request Smuggling attack. (CVE-2025-6442)</description>

            <title>USN-7839-1: Go Cryptography vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7839-1</link>
            <description>Damien Tournoud, Patrick Dawkins, Vince Parker, and Jules Duvivier
                discovered that Go Cryptography incorrectly handled public keys during SSH
                operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass
                authorization mechanisms.</description>

            <title>USN-7838-1: fetchmail vulnerability</title>
            <link>https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7838-1</link>
            <description>It was discovered that the fetchmail SMTP client incorrectly handled
                certain status code messages. An attacker controlling a malicious server
                could possibly use this issue to cause fetchmail to crash, resulting in a
                denial of service.</description>
